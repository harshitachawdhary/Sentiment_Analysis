@youtuberj.d,"actually i coded 



public class Main {
 public static void main ( String[ ] args {
      System.out.print (""the sum of numbers is "");
     int k = 2;
     int j = 3 ;
     int l = 4 ;
     int sum = k + j + l ;
      System.out.println(sum);
           }
 }




it showed an error . but ide bugged editor helped me and corrected it by code as 


public class Main {
 public static void main ( String[ ] args {
      System.out.print (""the sum of numbers is "");
     int k = 2;
     int j = 3 ;
     int l = 4 ;
     int sum = k + j + l ;
      System.out.println(sum);;

@user-if9kz5ls8p,"This video covers the basics of variables and data types in Java programming, including primitive data types, their ranges, and rules for naming variables.


Key moments:
00:07 Variables in Java act as containers where values are stored, determined by data types like Integer, Character, etc. Java has Primitive Data Types like Byte, Int, Float, Char, Double, Bool, Long, and Short.
          -Anatomy of a Java program includes documentation, package, input statements, interface statements, class definitions, and the essential main method class as the entry point for program execution.
          -Primitive Data Types in Java include Byte, Int, Float, Char, Double, Bool, Long, and Short, each serving specific data storage purposes within the program.
05:17 Non-primitive data types are derived from primitive data types. Understanding data types and variables in Java is crucial for programming, ensuring proper syntax and adherence to naming rules and reserved keywords.
          -Importance of understanding data types and variables in Java for programming. Syntax and naming rules play a vital role in Java programming.
          -Explanation of variables in Java as containers for values that can be changed. Emphasizing the significance of following rules for variable names.
          -Rules for naming variables in Java, including not starting with a digit, being case sensitive, and avoiding reserved keywords. Demonstrating examples of valid and invalid variable names.
11:11 Java variables have naming rules like no spaces, can start with alphabets, $, or _, and can contain digits. Choosing meaningful variable names enhances code readability and understanding, making programming easier and more efficient.
          -Java variables have specific naming rules to follow for better code organization and readability.
          -Choosing appropriate and descriptive variable names improves code comprehension and ease of maintenance.
          -Understanding data types in Java, including primitive and non-primitive types, is essential for effective programming.
17:07 The video discusses the eight primitive data types in Java, their sizes, default values, and how to choose the appropriate type based on the range of values. It also includes a Java program example to add three numbers and explains the difference between System.out.println and System.out.print.
          -Explanation of primitive data types in Java, their sizes, default values, and the importance of choosing the appropriate type based on the range of values.
          -Demonstration of a Java program to add three numbers using variables and System.out.println to display the sum.
          -Clarification on the difference between System.out.println and System.out.print in Java for printing output with or without a new line.",0,2024-06-19T15:42:21Z
